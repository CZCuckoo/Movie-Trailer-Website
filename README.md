# Movie Trailer Website
This is a movie trailer Website built to learn and practice Python.

## Instructions
Run entertainment_center.py to use this project.

##File Breakdown
Three files work together to make this project work. It consists of media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, and entertainment_center.py. Media.py contains a class "Movie", which is used to create instances of whichever movies you want to include in your site. Fresh_tomatoes.py contains HTML code, and two functions to dynamically create movie titles, and render each clickable movie poster.  Entertainment_center.py creates instances of the class Movie, containing all of the relevant information, catalogues all instances in an array, and opens fresh_tomatoes.py.
